                    <p style="color: white;">It was diskovery week. Grade eight was visiting Altai for a week. We lived in camps near the river. Now we were going up the mountain called The Devil's Finger. But the mountain was only getting steeper. Most of the people were already on the top screaming, laughing and taking selfies on the top of the mountain.</p>

                <p style="color: white;">I had never really been to a big concert that had a well-known band. A couple of weeks before the concert I got some information about it, but really didn't think much of it. I talked with some friends about the band and we all casually decided to go get tickets for it. Little did I know what an absolutely spectacular time I would have.</p>
